\usage{
fixed_commission_backtest_with_funding(
  prices,
  target_weights,
  funding_rates,
  trade_buffer = 0,
  initial_cash = 10000,
  margin = 0.05,

}
\arguments{
\item{prices}{Matrix of trade prices. Column 1 must be the timestamp or index.}

\item{target_weights}{Matrix of theoretical weights. Column 1 must be the timestamp or index.}

\item{funding_rates}{Matrix of funding rates applied to positions held at the end of the period in percent per period paid to long positions. Column 1 must be the timestamp or index.}

\item{trade_buffer}{Trade buffer parameter}

\item{initial_cash}{Inital cash balance}

\item{margin}{Percentage of exposure required as margin}

\item{commission_pct}{Percent commission charged on trades}

\item{capitalise_profits}{If TRUE, utilise profits and initial cash balance in determining position sizes. If FALSE, profits accrue as a cash balance and are not reinvested.}

\item{include_initial_state}{If TRUE, prepends an initial state row (t=0) to the results showing initial cash and zero positions. Defaults to FALSE for backward compatibility.}
}
\value{
long dataframe of results - dates, trades, commissions, value of portfolio components

Fixed Commission Backtest with Funding

\details{
\code{target_weights} should be date-aligned with \code{prices} - it is up to the user to lag \code{target_weights} as necessary to
ensure that trades occur at appropriate prices. Specifically, the function assumes that
\code{target_weights} are date-aligned with \code{prices} such that the price at which
you assume you trade into a target weight has the same index value.

\code{funding_rates} represents daily funding accrued to positions at the end of the period in percent per period paid to longs.
